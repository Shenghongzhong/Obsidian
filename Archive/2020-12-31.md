# The summary of 2020


Theme: Transformation - Being
[Balcklink] - 

### “How have you been?” 

It was a phrase we used a lot while we met someone in 2020. The pandemic has driven people crazy and missed the opportunity to meet people freely. Everyone becomes a risk. It’s a tough year for most of us but it’s my big year. Because I got my first paid job in the UK with the work visa.

I can’t verbally tell you how important it is to me. The only thing I’d say is when the Present Mao announced “Now we’re China"  at the beginning of People Republic of China on the 1st of October in 1949. I’m not surprised that I have this feeling as I achieved something called “financial independency” from my family. You may not know in China we don’t have a good finance system where in western countries people can apply for student loans to pursuit whatever dream they have. We don’t. We have to rely on our families.

I have reflected all my goals in 2019. It's a strange feeling. Because it feels ages ago. ![[David's vision 2020.png]]

Have I failed my vision in 2020?

Yes, and no.

It just the beginning of my vision. Who would have that thought in my first year of adult life that it's so difficult to get into it. It comes up with coronavirus. 

### Professional

#### Status : 4 out of 10

I actually didn't do well. Because I didn't concentrate on it a lot. I thought that they're not doing a cool thing. But when it comes to the question whether I can do it properly, I can't comment on it that much. I couldn't.  Hence, I should shut my mouth and do the job. When I said **do the job**, it's just really simple. You make a plan. You go with the plan. Memorize all the steps. Do it again. Write your summary at the end of day.



### Personal

#### Status: 3 out of 10
### Expectation: I must to look at life totally differently since the end of 2020

### The purpose of life

A fun fact is that I was wondering in a famous bookshop called Brick lane bookshop and asked the staff for the book recommendation. I was looking for something about life and the staff was shocked by my deep question. 


### Pleasure

What's the pleasure? I've been reading this book called **What are you doing with your life?**. It was a great book. Like a hammer to hit me heavily.  In the context of Chinese, we perceive 'Pleasure' in the eye of morality. SImply put, we see the pleasure as the representation of 'bad'. The first step to understand what the word pleasure is is not to deny its existence, if we intend to stay with the limited sorrow. 

As for me, I've escaped from it by denying it. I saw it as one of my guilty and many people feel guilt. I didn't do anything as I let my thought come into the place. I didn't enjoy that much as I am learning how to enjoy. The answer I have found in this book is to  theoretically. I was afraid of being so needy and demanding more and more.

' You are changing because it is necessary for itself.' The necessarity is not about the vision and plan and outcome. Or for some who would say, is it a good use? Simply put, What I'll be changing is because of the change itself that brings a 

##### **How can I make that move?** 

###### To create the necessarity 

The additional step to this is to conserve the energy which the nessarity of radicial revolution ( some would say transformation)
